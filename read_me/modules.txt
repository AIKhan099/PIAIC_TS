what is the difference between export and export default?
If you only need to export a single value from a module, or if the module represents a main feature of your application,
use export default . If you need to export multiple values from a module, or if you want to organize your code into smaller, 
reusable components, use export with named exports.

first.ts
let a = 5;
export default a;

second.ts
export const b = 10;
export const c = 2;


app.ts
import a from "./first";
import {b, c as d} from "./second";

console.log(a + b + d);
